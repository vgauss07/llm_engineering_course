Members who previously enrolled in direct deposit into either SoFi Money or SoFi Checking and Savings, whether currently still enrolled or not, do not qualify for this Direct Deposit Promotion. Bonuses are limited to one per SoFi Checking and Savings account. In the case of a joint account, only the primary account holder (the member who signed up first) is eligible for a bonus. Member must have an open SoFi Checking account in good standing at the time of the bonus payment.\\nPromotion Period\\n:\\nThe Direct Deposit Promotion will begin on 12/7/2023 at 12:01AM ET and end on 1/31/2026 at 11:59PM ET.\\nBonus Terms:\\nIn order to qualify for a bonus of either $50\\nOR\\n$300, SoFi must recognize receipt of at least one Eligible Direct Deposit (as defined below) from an Eligible Participant, the first of which must be before the end of the Promotion Period. The amount of the bonus, if any, will be calculated during the Direct Deposit Bonus Period as described and defined below.\\nEligible Direct Deposit means a recurring deposit of regular income to an account holder’s SoFi Checking or Savings account, including payroll, pension, or government benefit payments (e.g., Social Security), made by the account holder’s employer, payroll or benefits provider or government agency (“Eligible Direct Deposit”) via the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) Network.\\nAlthough we do our best to recognize all Eligible Direct Deposits, a small number of employers, payroll providers, benefits providers, or government agencies do not designate  payments as direct deposit. If you have satisfied the Eligible Direct Deposit requirements but have not received a cash bonus in your Checking account, please contact us at 855-456-7634 with the details of your Eligible Direct Deposit. After SoFi validates the details of your Eligible Direct Deposit, your Direct Deposit Bonus Period will be treated as having started on the date we receive your first Eligible Direct Deposit.\\nDeposits that are not from an employer or government agency, including but not limited to check deposits, peer-to-peer transfers (e.g., transfers from PayPal, Venmo, etc.), merchant transactions (e.g., transactions from PayPal, Stripe, Square, etc.), and bank ACH funds transfers and wire transfers from external accounts, or are non-recurring in nature (e.g. IRS tax refunds), do not constitute Eligible Direct Deposit activity. SoFi Bank shall, in its sole discretion, assess each account holder’s Eligible Direct Deposit activity to determine eligibility and may require additional documentation to complete this verification.\\nDirect Deposit Bonus Period:\\nThe Direct Deposit Bonus Period begins when SoFi receives an Eligible Direct Deposit of $1 or more within the Promotion Period and ends 25 calendar days later (the “Direct Deposit Bonus Period”), subject to the Bonus Terms. For the avoidance of doubt, the Direct Deposit Bonus Period shall not extend beyond the Promotion Period.\\nBonus Amount:\\nThe bonus amount will vary based on the total amount of Direct Deposits received during the Direct Deposit Bonus Period.\\nTotal Direct Deposit Amount Received During Direct Deposit Bonus Period\\nCash Bonus Tier\\n$1.00 - $999.99\\n$0\\n$1,000.00 - $4,999.99\\n$50\\n$5,000.00 or more\\n$300\\nOnce the Direct Deposit Bonus Period has elapsed, SoFi will determine if you have met the offer requirements and will deposit any earned bonus into your checking account within seven (7) business days. For example, if SoFi receives between $1,000.00 and $4,999.99 in Eligible Direct Deposits during the Direct Deposit Bonus Period, you will receive a one-time cash bonus of $50. A member may only qualify for one bonus tier and will not be eligible for future bonus payments if Eligible Direct Deposits subsequently increase after the Direct Deposit Bonus Period.\\nBonus Payment Timeline:\\nSoFi will credit members who meet qualification criteria within seven (7) business days of the end of the Direct Deposit Bonus Period.\\nTax Reporting:\\nBonuses are considered income and may be reportable on IRS Form 1099-INT or Form 1042-S as applicable.\\nOther Important Details:\\nSoFi reserves the right to exclude any members from participating in this Promotion for any reason, such as suspected fraud, misuse, or suspicious activity. Sofi also reserves the right to modify or end the Promotion at any time.\\nInterest Rates:\\nSoFi members can earn the following annual percentage yields (APY):\\nWith Eligible Direct Deposit:\\n•Savings (including Vaults)\\n: 3.80% APY.\\n•Checking\\n: 0.50% APY.\\n•No minimum Direct Deposit amount is required to earn the 3.80% APY on savings.\\nWithout Eligible Direct Deposit:\\n•Savings (including Vaults)\\n: 1.00% APY.\\n•Checking\\n: 0.50% APY.\\nOther Rates Details:\\n•Rates are variable and are subject to change at any time.\\n•Rates are current as of\\n1/24/25.\\n•No minimum balance is required.\\nAdditional information can be found at\\nhttp://www.sofi.com/legal/banking-rate-sheet\\n.\\n4\\nSoFi members with Eligible Direct Deposit activity can earn 3.80% annual percentage yield (APY) on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50%  APY on checking balances. Eligible Direct Deposit means a recurring deposit of regular income to an account holder’s SoFi Checking or Savings account, including payroll, pension, or government benefit payments (e.g., Social Security), made by the account holder’s employer, payroll or benefits provider or government agency (“Eligible Direct Deposit”) via the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) Network during a 30-day Evaluation Period (as defined below).\\nAlthough we do our best to recognize all Eligible Direct Deposits, a small number of employers, payroll providers, benefits providers, or government agencies do not designate payments as direct deposit. To ensure you're earning 3.80% APY, we encourage you to check your APY Details page the day after your Eligible Direct Deposit arrives. If your APY is not showing as 3.80%, contact us at 855-456-7634 with the details of your Eligible Direct Deposit. As long as SoFi Bank can validate those details, you will start earning 3.80% APY from the date you contact SoFi for the rest of the current 30-day Evaluation Period. You will also be eligible for 3.80% APY on future Eligible Direct Deposits, as long as SoFi Bank can validate them.\\nDeposits that are not from an employer, payroll, or benefits provider or government agency, including but not limited to check deposits, peer-to-peer transfers (e.g., transfers from PayPal, Venmo, etc.), merchant transactions (e.g., transactions from PayPal, Stripe, Square, etc.), and bank ACH funds transfers and wire transfers from external accounts, or are non-recurring in nature (e.g., IRS tax refunds), do not constitute Eligible Direct Deposit activity. There is no minimum Eligible Direct Deposit amount required to qualify for the stated interest rate. SoFi members with Eligible Direct Deposit are eligible for other SoFi Plus benefits.\\nAs an alternative to Direct Deposit, SoFi members with Qualifying Deposits can earn 3.80% APY on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50%  APY on checking balances. Qualifying Deposits means one or more deposits that, in the aggregate, are equal to or greater than $5,000 to an account holder’s SoFi Checking and Savings account (“Qualifying Deposits”) during a 30-day Evaluation Period (as defined below). Qualifying Deposits only include those deposits from the following eligible sources: (i) ACH transfers, (ii) inbound wire transfers, (iii) peer-to-peer transfers (i.e., external transfers from PayPal, Venmo, etc. and internal peer-to-peer transfers from a SoFi account belonging to another account holder), (iv) check deposits, (v) instant funding to your SoFi Bank Debit Card, (vi) push payments to your SoFi Bank Debit Card, and (vii) cash deposits. Qualifying Deposits do not include: (i) transfers between an account holder’s Checking account, Savings account, and/or Vaults; (ii) interest payments; (iii) bonuses issued by SoFi Bank or its affiliates; or (iv) credits, reversals, and refunds from SoFi Bank, N.A. (“SoFi Bank”) or from a merchant. SoFi members with Qualifying Deposits are not eligible for other SoFi Plus benefits.\\nSoFi Bank shall, in its sole discretion, assess each account holder’s Eligible Direct Deposit activity and Qualifying Deposits throughout each 30-Day Evaluation Period to determine the applicability of rates and may request additional documentation for verification of eligibility. The 30-Day Evaluation Period refers to the “Start Date” and “End Date” set forth on the APY Details page of your account, which comprises a period of 30 calendar days (the “30-Day Evaluation Period”). You can access the APY Details page at any time by logging into your SoFi account on the SoFi mobile app or SoFi website and selecting either (i) Banking > Savings > Current APY or (ii) Banking > Checking > Current APY. Upon receiving an Eligible Direct Deposit or receipt of $5,000 in Qualifying Deposits to your account, you will begin earning 3.80% APY on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50%  on checking balances on or before the following calendar day. You will continue to earn these APYs for (i) the remainder of the current 30-Day Evaluation Period and through the end of the subsequent 30-Day Evaluation Period and (ii) any following 30-day Evaluation Periods during which SoFi Bank determines you to have Eligible Direct Deposit activity or $5,000 in Qualifying Deposits without interruption.\\nSoFi Bank reserves the right to grant a grace period to account holders following a change in Eligible Direct Deposit activity or Qualifying Deposits activity before adjusting rates. If SoFi Bank grants you a grace period, the dates for such grace period will be reflected on the APY Details page of your account. If SoFi Bank determines that you did not have Eligible Direct Deposit activity or $5,000 in Qualifying Deposits during the current 30-day Evaluation Period and, if applicable, the grace period, then you will begin earning the rates earned by account holders without either Eligible Direct Deposit or Qualifying Deposits until SoFi Bank recognizes Eligible Direct Deposit activity or receives $5,000 in Qualifying Deposits in a subsequent 30-Day Evaluation Period. For the avoidance of doubt, an account holder with both Eligible Direct Deposit activity and Qualifying Deposits will earn the rates earned by account holders with Eligible Direct Deposit.\\nSeparately, SoFi members who enroll in SoFi Plus by paying the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee every 30 days can also earn 3.80% APY on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50%  APY on checking balances. For additional details, see the SoFi Plus Terms and Conditions at\\nhttps://www.sofi.com/terms-of-use/#plus\\n.\\nMembers without either Eligible Direct Deposit activity or Qualifying Deposits, as determined by SoFi Bank, during a 30-Day Evaluation Period and, if applicable, the grace period, or who do not enroll in SoFi Plus by paying the SoFi Plus Subscription Fee every 30 days, will earn 1.00% APY on savings balances (including Vaults) and 0.50%  APY on checking balances.\\nInterest rates are variable and subject to change at any time. These rates are current as of 1/24/2025. There is no minimum balance requirement.
